### Requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/TheAlienMann/NizekTakeHome/blob/main/iOS%20Code%20Challenge.pdf)

#### What you will find here though:
1. An MVVM Architecture.
2. DI and the composition being done in the AppDelegate.
3. The UI is in Code.
4. The Binding part of MVVM is in KVO (just what to show you that i do know it, it was just hard to explain it in/with words.)
