### Requirements can be found [here](./iOS Code Challenge.pdf)

#### What you will find here though:
1. An MVVM Architecture.
2. DI and the composing being done in the AppDelegate.
3. the UI is in Code.
4. the Binding part of MVVM is in KVO (just what to show you that i do know it, it was just hard to explain it in/with words.)
5. unfortunately there is no Unit Test and no Integration Test.
6. there was a case in the requirements that the app should fallback to the login screen, after 10 seconds though, that one too, i haven't done that. but the 30 seconds works.
