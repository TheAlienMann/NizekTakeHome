### Requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/TheAlienMann/NizekTakeHome/blob/main/iOS%20Code%20Challenge.pdf)

#### What you will find here though:
1. An MVVM Architecture.
2. DI and the composition being done in the AppDelegate.
3. The UI is in Code.
4. The Binding part of MVVM is in KVO (just what to show you that i do know it, it was just hard to explain it in/with words.)
5. Unfortunately there is no Unit Test nor Integration Test.
6. There was a case in the requirements that the app should fallback to the login screen, after 10 seconds though, that one too, i haven't done that. but the 30 seconds works.
7. Even though the code should run on any version of xcode above 11, I believe I should say that I build this in xcode 13.2, the minimum iOS version suppoeted is 13.0
